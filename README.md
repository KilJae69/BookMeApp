## Lessons Learned

The development of BookMeApp has been a journey of learning, particularly in utilizing advanced features of Supabase like triggers, functions, and edge functions. The greatest lesson learned was the importance of thoughtful architecture planning before diving into developmentâ€” a lesson invaluable for future projects.
